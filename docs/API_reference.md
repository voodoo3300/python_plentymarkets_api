### LOGIN <a name='login'></a>

The login request is sent automatically, as soon as the object is instantiated. There are five methods of providing credentials.

1. **direct**: Providing them over STDIN *[Usually only useful for testing on someone else's machine]* <br>
    `login_method = 'direct'`, `login_data = None` (empty by default)
2. **keyring**: Enter the credentials once per STDIN and save them into a keyring *[Very convenient for commands that are started manually doesn't work for cronjobs]* <br>
    `login_method = 'keyring'`, `login_data = None` (empty by default)
3. **plain_text**: Provide the username and the password as arguments *[Highly discouraged in combination with storing the passwords in plain text files or even worse in the code]* <br>
    `login_method = 'plain_text'`, `login_data = {'user': 'example_user', 'password': '1234abcd'}`
4. **gpg_encrypted**: Provide the username as an argument and a path to a GPG encrypted file for the password *[Works for cronjobs and manual running]* <br>
    `login_method = 'gpg_encrypted'`, `login_data = {'user': 'example_user', 'file_path': '/path/to/encrypted_file.gpg'}`
5. **azure_credential**: Provide the identifier for a azure credential manager instance and fetch the username and password from it directly. <br>
    `login_method = 'azure_credential'`, `login_data = {'credential_identifier': 'cred123'}`

**WARNING**: The logging module activated by the **debug option** of the `PlentySync` object, **will print your username and password** into the log as part of the response body.

#### Example for a GPG encrypted file workflow (on Linux) <a name='gpg_workflow'></a>

The idea behind the GnuPG encrypted file is to simply write the password
of the Plentymarkets REST API user into a `.txt` file and to encrypt that file.
`plenty_api` is then going to decrypt it during authentication and
read the password.
With the username and password, `plenty_api` can then receive an Oauth2
bearer token to be used for authentication.

Here is an example (on Linux):
```
# With a preceding space to skip entering the line into the bash history
  echo "password" > pw.txt
gpg --encrpyt --sign --recipient gpg-key@email.com pw.txt
```

Within python:
```
api = plenty_api.PlentyApi(
        base_url='https://company.plentymarkets-cloud01.com',
        login_method='gpg_encrypted',
        login_data={'user': 'api_user', 'file_path': '/home/user/pw.txt.gpg'}
    )
```

This will try to access your gpg key through your gpg agent, which manages
access to the key.

In some cases, you might want to increase the time until the passphrase
times out (in which case you would have to enter the password again).
This is how you can modify the time:
```
echo -e "default-cache-ttl 18000\nmax-cache-ttl 86400\nignore-cache-for-signing" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
```
This will set the default timeout time for a passphrase to 18000s (5h)
and the maximum timeout time to 86400s (24h) (meaning even if you use
the key multiple times during the 24h, after 24h you will have to enter
the password again).

### GET requests: <a name='get-requests'></a>

#### Orders <a name='get-order-section'></a>

##### plenty_api_get_pending_reorders: <a name='get-pending-reorders'></a>

Pull all reorders that have not been closed.

[*Optional parameter*]:

The **sender** parameter takes the ID of a contact in Plentymarkets, which in the case of a reorder should be a producer/supplier.
The **receiver** parameter takes the ID of a warehouse in Plentymarkets.

[*Output format*]:

There are currently two supported output formats: 'json' and 'dataframe'.  
The 'json' format simply returns the raw response, without page information and with multiple pages combined into a single data structure.  
The 'dataframe' format transforms that data structure into a pandas DataFrame, which contains subparts in json, that can be split further by the user application.

---

##### plenty_api_get_pending_redistributions: <a name='get-pending-redistributions'></a>

Pull all redistributions that have not been closed.

[*Optional parameter*]:

The **sender** parameter takes the ID of a contact in Plentymarkets, which in the case of a reorder should be a producer/supplier.
The **receiver** parameter takes the ID of a warehouse in Plentymarkets.
The **shipping_packages** parameter determines if shipping packages shall be added to the response and the extend of information about them. Valid values are ['', 'minimal', 'full'], no shipping packages are added by default. Pulling shipping packages requires additional requests (1 per pallet and 1 per package on each pallet).

[*Output format*]:

There are currently two supported output formats: 'json' and 'dataframe'.  
The 'json' format simply returns the raw response, without page information and with multiple pages combined into a single data structure.  
The 'dataframe' format transforms that data structure into a pandas DataFrame, which contains subparts in json, that can be split further by the user application.

---

##### plenty_api_get_orders_by_date: <a name='get-orders-by-date'></a>

By default, the *start* date is set to **yesterday** and the *end* date is set to **today**. You can adjust the date range by providing a string representation in one of the following formats for either both or one of these parameters.

- YEAR-MONTH-DAY                                    (2020-09-16)        [ISO 8601 date format]

- YEAR-MONTH-DAYTHOUR:MINUTE:SECOND+UTC-OFFSET      (2020-09-16T08:00)  [W3C date format]

The default `date_type` is **creation**, but you can set it to any of the following 4 types:
- **creation** [date and time when the order was created on PlentyMarkets]
- **change**   [date and time of the last change, within the order]
- **payment**  [date and time when the payment was either automatically received by the order or assigned to the order]
- **delivery** [date and time of the removal of products from the stock of the shipping warehouse]

[*Optional parameter*]:

##### plenty_api_get_shipping_pallets: <a name='get-pallets'></a>

Each order can have one or more shipping pallets filled with shipping packages, this route pulls either all shipping pallets or those that are connected to a specific order. A shipping pallet response **DOES NOT CONTAIN** the package items, in order to fetch these you have to either use the `plenty_api_get_shipping_package_items` route for each pallet or use the wrapper method `plenty_api_get_shipping_packages_for_order` to pull all pallets and packages for a specific order.

[*Optional parameter*]:

The **order_id** parameter restricts the request to all pallets connect to the given order ID.

There are two types of report formats: *minimal* and *full*, the structure of both is similar but minimal reduces the output to an absolute minimum (variation ID, pallet ID, package ID, package NO on pallet, quantity, total quantity per variation and a mapping of package IDs to pallet IDs).

[*Required parameter*]:

The **order_id** parameter contains a valid Plentymarkets Order ID.

[*Optional parameter*]:

#### Orders <a name='post-oders-section'></a>

#### plenty_api_create_redistribution <a name='post-redistribution'></a>

[*Required parameter*]:

The **template** parameter contains a simplified version of the JSON required for the creation of a redistribution, it is used for multiple purposes, at a minimum it has to contain essential IDs of the sender and receiver storage warehouse, the ID of the Plentymarkets system, and basic data about variations (ID, quantity). This information is combined with some boilerplate elements to create a valid JSON for the POST `/rest/redistribution` route. But it can also include outgoing and incoming storage locations in order to automate some pesky manual labor (More on that below in the example). The **book_out** boolean is used to indicate if any actual booking shall be performed by this function or if this should be done by the storage workers, by default this feature is off.  
Please refer to the [Plentymarkets Dev documentation: REST API POST redistribution](https://developers.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/plentymarkets-rest-api/index.html#/Order/post_rest_redistributions).

[*Example*]:

Here is an example of a template for a redistribution:
Required elements are: `plenty_id`, `sender`, `receiver`, and at least one variation in `variations`.
For `variations`, the required elements are `variation_id` and `total_quantity`.
For `locations` (and for `targets`) the required elements are `location_id` and `quantity`.

Without `locations`, the redistribution order will only include the listing of items all outgoing transactions have to be added manually.
When you include `locations` without `targets` only outgoing transactions are created automatically.
And if you include `targets` for the `locations`, incoming transactions are booked automatically as well.
The latter makes sense for example if you want to book all items on a transit location first.

```json
{
    'plenty_id': 12345,
    'sender': 104,
    'receiver': 114,
    'variations': [
        {
            'variation_id': 12345,
            'total_quantity': 10,
            'name': 'Awesome_product',
            'amounts': 10.50,
            'locations': [
                {
                    'location_id': 10, 'quantity': 5,
                    'targets': [
                        {'location_id': 3, 'quantity': 3},
                        {'location_id': 2, 'quantity': 2}
                    ]
                },
                {
                    'location_id': 12, 'quantity': 5,
                    'targets': [
                        {'location_id': 4, 'quantity': 2},
                        {'location_id': 5, 'quantity': 3}
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

You can also add the following fields to each variation: 'batch', 'bestBeforeDate', 'identification'.

This will be transformed into the following valid JSON object for the REST API:
```json
{
    'typeId': 15,
    'plentyId': 12345,
    'orderItems': [
        {
            'typeId': 1,
            'itemVariationId': 12345,
            'quantity': 10,
            'orderItemName': 'Awesome_product'
        }
    ],
    'relations': [
        {
            'referenceType': 'warehouse',
            'referenceId': 104,
            'relation': 'sender'
        },
        {
            'referenceType': 'warehouse',
            'referenceId': 114,
            'relation': 'receiver'
        }
    ]
}
```

And two outgoing transactions will be created:
```json
{
    'quantity': 5,
    'direction': 'out',
    'status': 'regular',
    'warehouseLocationId': 10
}

{
    'quantity': 5,
    'direction': 'out',
    'status': 'regular',
    'warehouseLocationId': 12
}
```

As well as 4 incoming transactions:
```json
{
    'quantity': 3,
    'direction': 'in',
    'status': 'regular',
    'warehouseLocationId': 3
}

{
    'quantity': 2,
    'direction': 'in',
    'status': 'regular',
    'warehouseLocationId': 2
}

{
    'quantity': 2,
    'direction': 'in',
    'status': 'regular',
    'warehouseLocationId': 4
}

{
    'quantity': 3,
    'direction': 'in',
    'status': 'regular',
    'warehouseLocationId': 5
}
```

If you choose to activate **book_out**, the method will also set the initiation date with the current date:  
(*WARNING* after the initiation of an order it *cannot be changed/deleted*)
```json
    'dates': [
        {
            'typeId': 16,
            'date': '2021-01-01T09:00:00+01:00'
        }
    ]
```

Book out any outgoing transactions and if they exist also the incoming transactions and finally set the finish date with the current date:
```json
    'dates': [
        {
            'typeId': 17,
            'date': '2021-01-01T09:00:01+01:00'
        }
    ]
```

[*Output format*]:

Return a POST request JSON response, if one of the requests fails return the error message.
When the **template** object cannot be validated, the method will return: `{'error': 'invalid_template'}`.

#### plenty_api_create_reorder <a name='post-reorder'></a>

[*Required parameter*]:

The **template** parameter contains a simplified version of the JSON required for the creation of a reorder, it contains information about the sender, receiver, the target plenty system and the variations. Optionally, the user can add location IDs to create incoming transactions automatically.
Please refer to the [Plentymarkets Dev Documnetation: REST API POST reorder](https://developers.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/plentymarkets-rest-api/index.html#/Order/post_rest_reorders)

[*Example*]:

Here is an example of a template for a reorder:
Required elements are: `plenty_id`, `sender`, `receiver`, and at least one variation in `variations`.
For `variations`, the required elements are `variation_id` and `total_quantity`.
For `locations` the required elements are `location_id` and `quantity`.

Without `locations` the reorder will only contain a listing of items, each transaction has to be created manually.

```json
{
    'plenty_id': 12345,
    'sender': 1234,
    'receiver': 111,
    'variations': [
        {
            'variation_id': 1234,
            'total_quantity': 2,
            'name': 'Awesome_test with incoming',
            'amounts': 10,
            'locations': [
                {'location_id': 1234, 'quantity': 2}
            ]
        },
        {
            'variation_id': 2345,
            'total_quantity': 1,
            'name': 'Awesome_test without incoming',

    ]
}
```

[*Output format*]:

#### plenty_api_create_transaction <a name=post-transaction></a>

This route is used to create a new transaction for an order. A transaction is an exchange of stock between two sides (usually something like warehouse -> customer, warehouse -> warehouse, etc.). Each order contains a part called `relations`, which describes the sender and the receiver of an order.  
The transaction is then created with an `in` or `out` direction, `out` means that the stock is moved out of the sender warehouse and, `in` means that the stock is moved into the receiver warehouse. The warehouse location ID is used to describe the specific location from which the stock is taken or where the stock shall be moved.  
On their own transactions don't actually change the stock, they have to be booked to actually change the stock of a warehouse.

[*Required parameter*]:

The **order_item_id** parameter relates to the specific item (variation) of an order, for which the transaction shall occur. The **json** parameter contains a single JSON object, describing the quantity, direction and target warehouse location.
Please refer to the [Plentymarkets Dev documentation: REST API POST transaction](https://developers.plentymarkets.com/en-gb/plentymarkets-rest-api/index.html#/Order/post_rest_orders_items__orderItemId__transactions).

```json
{
    'orderItemId': 12,
    'quantity': 2,
    'direction': 'out',
    'status': 'regular',
    'warehouseLocationId': 5
}
```

[*Output format*]:

Return a POST request JSON response, if one of the requests fails return the error message.
If the **order_item_id** parameter is not filled the method will return: `{'error': 'missing_parameter'}`.
If the **json** parameter contains an invalid JSON object the method will return: `{'error': 'invalid_json'}`.

#### plenty_api_create_booking <a name=post-booking></a>

This route is used to book in/out all pending transactions of an order.

[*Required parameter*]:

The **item_id**, **variation_id**, and **warehouse_id** parameters are required to book the stock from the correct variation and the correct warehouse. The **item_id** parameter contains the Plentymarkets assigned ID of the container of the variation. **variation_id** describes the assigned ID for the specific variation to book stock for and **warehouse_id** contains the assigned ID for the warehouse, that contains the target location, which in case of no given location ID points to the standard location (ID 0) of the warehouse.
The **quantity** field contains the amount of stock to book from the target location for the given variation, it's data type is float and it has to contain a negative value.

[*Optional parameter*]:

Optionally, it is possible to only book stock from a given **batch** and **bestBeforeDate**.
The dates are accepted in the following formats:
- YEAR-MONTH-DAY                                    (2020-09-16)        [ISO 8601 date format]
- YEAR-MONTH-DAYTHOUR:MINUTE                        (2020-09-16T08:00)
- YEAR-MONTH-DAYTHOUR:MINUTE:SECOND+UTC-OFFSET      (2020-09-16T08:00)  [W3C date format]

By specifying a storage location ID within **location_id**, you can target a specific location instead of the standard location (ID 0).

[*Output format*]:

If the **name_id** or **name** field is not filled the method will return: `{'error': 'missing_parameter'}`.

### Extra features <a name=extras></a>

**Activating a progress bar for a CLI application**, you can activate a progress bar for requests with multiple pages, by setting the `cli_progress_bar` class attribute to `True` at any point before making the request. You can deactivate it at any point as well, by setting it to `False` again.  

Example
```python
import plenty_api

plenty = plenty_api.PlentyApi(base_url='...')
plenty.cli_progress_bar = True
variations = plenty.plenty_api_get_variations()
plenty.cli_progress_bar = False
```
